Hey, I am Xinjian ZHANG, a phd student of [FUDAN Universtiy](http://www.cs.fudan.edu.cn) from 2017, majoring in computer science. I graduated from [China University of petroleum](http://www.upc.edu.cn) by 2016 and During the last year in UPC, I have learned at [Ecoles Nationales Supérieures de Techniques Avancées](http://www.ensta-bretagne.eu/index.php/the-ensta-group-the-advanced-techniques/) as an international exchange student.

However, I confuse about which direction should I set foot in.
So i decided to strengthen myself and want to write something on it.  

May be travel, may be delicious food, may be tensorflow, Who knows.




##### Project

Coming soon...
